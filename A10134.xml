            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>In Empires, Kingdomes, States, Cities, Families, wee read and ſee the truth of the Oracle which ſaid to ATTALVS King of Bithinia, <hi>THOU AND THY SON, NOT THE SONS OF THY SON.</hi> His Maieſtie, who now holdeth the raines of this peaceable and flouriſhing kingdome, is the onely King knowne in the world by ſtories, who can reckon neere two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres ſince his roiall Anceſtors, of whom he is lincally deſcended, wore Crownes and Scepters. In France they thinke it much, if a man can prove his Nobilitie by foure
<pb facs="tcp:12290:3"/>Deſcents. Since three hundred and odde yeeres that SIR GILBERT HAMMILTON came from England to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was there advanced to all titles and degrees of honours, of dignities, of greatneſſe among the moſt noble and honourable of the Realme by the HEROS of thoſe dayes, and King without peere ROBERT BRVCE, who had knowne in England the antiquitie of his noble houſe, and of all men then living, could beſt iudge of his courage, martiall actes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; and being preferred there to the mariage of the onely Daughter to my Lord Earle of Murray, the Kings Nephew by his Princely Siſter, became the Stocke of the illuſtrious Race of the HAMMILTONS in Scotland, whereof your Honour is the golden head; how many Deſcents, how many generations, may be reckoned?</p>
            <p>The fables tell of BELLEROPHON, how after he had done many feates of armes, not ſo much by his owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſtrength, as by the helpe of his winged Horſe called PEGASVS, he waxed proud, and attempting with the ſame wings to mount up to heaven, was flung to the earth, and brake his leg: whereby they teach us in a myſticall ſenſe, that many, after they have beene borne upon the wings of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces favour, and thereby have done good ſervices, conceive too ambitious and proud hopes, and, as if favour were deſert, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to aſcend into heaven, to exalt their Throne above the reſt of the ſtarres, and to be like unto their Maker, are cut downe to the ground in an inſtant, where all their pompe is laid in a grave of ſhame and diſhonour; as the Scripture ſpeaketh of the King of Babylon, under the name of LVCIFER. In all the ancient ſtories hardly ſhall we finde any great man, whoſe prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors or himſelfe have not beene ſtained with the blot of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt their Soveraignes, or of ſome negligence of their dutie towards them: But your Honours forefathers had ever their affections ſo addicted to our Kings, that King IAMES the third, with the conſent of the States, and applauſe of the whole Realme, thought them worthy to be rewarded with the mariage of his onely and deare Siſter, whom he gave in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
<pb facs="tcp:12290:3"/>to IAMES Lord Hammilton, of whom your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is come by many lineall ſucceſſions. This proximitie of blood to our Kings, hath ever beene to your Anceſters, and to your owne ſelfe, a moſt attractive Adamant, drawing and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſeparably your hearts, deſires, wills, affections, duties, and ſervices to their will and deſires in all innocencie and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to Gods commandement: the practice whereof is the ſtay of the State, and the maintainer of peace in the Church and Common-weale; FEARE GOD, AND THE KING; AND MEDDLE NOT WITH FACTIOVS MEN. So that this may be the Poeſie of the Cognizance of your Honours moſt ancient and honourable Family, FIDEET OBSEQVIO.</p>
            <p>Of this fidelitie, of theſe long, profitable, and acceptable ſervices to our Kings, continued in your Lordſhips familie from generation to generation, and moſt effectually confirmed by your owne generous, wiſe and good cariage in the Court and in the State, the Kings Maieſtie is a moſt glorious witneſſe, and a moſt magnificent rewarder: For that affection which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſheweth to your Honour, thoſe Dignities wherewith hee hath honoured you, namely this laſt of LORD STEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARD of his royall Houſe, what are they but publike teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the continuation of your good, faithfull and well liked ſervices to his Maieſties Royall perſon, to our moſt excellent and hopefull Prince his Royall and onely Sonne, and to the ſtates of both kingdomes? In the Court you are to his Maieſtie that which IOSEPH was to PHARAO King of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, OBADIAH to ACHAB King of Iſrael, MORDECAI to AHASVERVS King of Perſia, and ELIAKIM, to whom God gave the key of the houſe of DAVID, to the good King EZECHIAH, and moſt like unto THEODORVS in the Court of VALENS Emperour of the Orient; who being come of a moſt ancient and noble ſtocke, and well brought up from the Cradle, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any of the Imperiall Court in modeſtie, wiſedome, eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and good carriage, ever ſeemed better than the charges
<pb facs="tcp:12290:4"/>and places whereunto he was advanced, and was the onely man whoſe tongue was never licentiouſly unbridled, never ſpake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration and foreſight, yea was never ſhut through feare of danger, or hope of preferment, and therefore was equally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of great and ſmall, as your Lp. for the ſame vertues is much reſpected and loved of all ſtates and degrees in both nations: For, by Gods ſpeciall and rare bleſſing, you carry your ſelfe in all your demeanour at Court and abroad ſo wiſely, that I may boldly affirme, that to none, if not to you, doth belong that rare and wonderfull praiſe which Cicero giveth to BRVTVS, and Marcellin to PRETEXTATVS, ſaying, that they did no thing to pleaſe, yet whatſoever they did, pleaſed; and that other which all men gave to ANTHEMIVS Governour to the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Emperour ARCADIVS, HE SEEMED TO BE WISE, AND SO HE WAS. The Royall Prophet David ſaith moſt truly in the twelfth Pſalme, that wicked men walke on every ſide, when raſcals are exalted among the ſonnes of men: Then DAVID fleeth, and DOEG triumpheth. But innocencie is protected, oppreſſion is repreſſed, the ſtates flouriſh, kingdomes proſper, the people have peace; when gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and worthy men, who hate couetouſneſſe, flattery, and envy, who reſpect above all worldly things the honour of the King, who have no other end of their actions but the weal of the State, are neereſt to Kings. DARIVS King of Perſia, holding a Pomegranet in his hand, wiſhed, in ſtead of all treaſures, to have as many ZOPYRES as there were graines in that Apple: ſhewing, that there is nothing ſo needfull and profitable to Kings as faithfull Counſellers and ſervants of the chiefe of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, ſuch as ZOPYRVS was; and yet no Iewell ſo rare to be found: For though there be many nobles about Kings, there be few upon whoſe fidelitie, wiſdome and magnanimitie Kings may relie. Therefore bleſſed is this Realme, wherein ſo many ZOPYRES, ſo many of the heads of the Nobilitie, are ever neere our moſt wiſe, religious and righteous Kings eares: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom your Honour ſhineth as a radiant Planet among the bright and gliſtering ſtarres.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:12290:4"/>
            <p>What are generoſitie, wiſdome, faithfulneſſe to the King, love to the native ſoyle, good and acceptable ſervices to the State, but gorgeous and glittering ſinnes, if they be ſevered from true godlineſſe, from faith in our Lord IESVS CHRIST, from love to his beloved Church, from holineſſe of life and good workes, acceptable to God? What are Courtiers, what are the Nobles of the Land, what are Kings themſelves, without Chriſtian vertues, but like a certaine people of Aſia, which were wont to carry earthen veſſels in golden Boxes? What are all their riches, honours, dignities, pleaſures, paſtimes, delights, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles but faire vaniſhing bubbles, which muſt give place to things more ſolid, that bring to true beleevers an everlaſting felicitie and ioy? For as the ſhell of an Egge, howſoever it bee white, ſmoothe, and well formed, muſt bee broken, that the Chicken may come out, and that, wherefore the ſhell was made, appeare: So the faſhion and ſhew of this world muſt paſſe away, that the incomprehenſible eſtate which God hath laid up, and keepeth in heaven for his deare ones, may ſhine and bee made manifeſt. Therefore where greatneſſe and godlineſſe, where wordly prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives and celeſtiall priviledges, where carnall and ſpirituall nobilitie, faith in Chriſt, and faithfulneſſe to the King, love to the State, and charitie to the Church, a vehement paſſion for the common-weale and true zeale to God, are ioyned and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together, as they are in your Honours perſon; every man that ſeeth them is bound to acknowledge, to admire, and to praiſe them, and to render all honour and ſerviceable duties to thoſe whom God hath ſo mercifully &amp; wonderfully honoured.</p>
            <p>This then is the cauſe of the Dedication of theſe my Sermons to your Honour. For who ſhall blame me, if ſo far as in me is, I honour with my Penne a Lord, whom God hath ſorichly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his Gifts? And who ſhall denie, but that Sermons of the righteous mans evils, and of the Lords deliverances, may, yea ſhould bee dedicated to a Lord, who though living in the midſt of worldly contentments, eateth the Paſchall Lambe, not onely with unleavened bread of ſincerity &amp; truth, but alſo with the bitter hearbes of godly ſorrow, ever ſighing, ever ſobbing
<pb facs="tcp:12290:5"/>before God for the affliction of Ioſeph, ever praying, ever cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven for the deliverance &amp; reſtauration of Ieruſalem lapping of the glib-ſliding pleaſures of this tranſitorie and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive life, as GEDEONS ſouldiers lapped of the running wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and taſting them with thanks-giving as temporall gifts of God, but drinking great draughts of teares flowing from the eyes of ſpirituall ſadneſſe, ever expecting with a moſt firme hope the accompliſhment of the Prophecies by the ruine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and deliverance of the Church; ever haſtening &amp; ſetting forward that neceſſary &amp; glorious worke, by courageous and faithfull counſels, and all other meanes lawfull and poſſible.</p>
            <p>I cannot omit that which toucheth my ſelfe: For being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from France for the Goſpell of Chriſt, and for my nations ſake, and comming to his Maieſties Court, where like unto ENDIMION after his long ſleepe, I ſaw nothing but new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeemed to my ſelfe as a man fallen out of the Cloudes; your Honour embraced me with ſuch kindneſſe and humanitie, and recommended me to his Maieſtie with ſuch affection, that I ſhould be iuſtly condemned of ingratitude, if I did ever forget it.</p>
            <p>Let that foule vice goe and burie it ſelfe in the gulfe of hell where it was bred; I had rather be eſteemed clowniſh and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, by rendring to your Honour, in theſe unpoliſhed ſheetes, ſuch thankes as I can, than called unthankefull by neglecting of my dutie. The poore woman with her mite, was as acceptable to God, as the rich men with their rich gifts, becauſe ſhee gave what ſhe had with a free heart: And great Lords receive of their Vaſſals ſtrawes, and trifles for homage of great tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I doubt not but this ſmall and unworthy hommage ſhall finde in your moſt worthy Lordſhip, the like acceptation; as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from one, who with a true heart, poures out his prayers to God for the increaſing of all the bleſſings of this life, and of the life to come, upon your moſt honourable Perſon, and illuſtrious Familie, and who is</p>

               <p>All the Tragedies, though fabulouſly written, are made of the true miſeries and ſtrange calamities of Kings, Princes, and other great men of the world. Runne thorow the ſtories of Heathen men: of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Kings, how few ſhall yee finde, whom a drie and peaceable death hath ſent to the grave, where now the worme feedeth ſweetly on them! In the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ye ſee <hi>Saul,</hi> poſſeſſed with the Divel, murthering the Lords Prieſts, ſmiting with the edge of the ſword the whole Citie of <hi>Nob,</hi> men and women, children and ſucklings, Oxen, Aſſes and Sheepe, ſeeking to kill his owne ſonne and heyre, and finally imbruing his unmercifull and pittileſſe hands with his owne blood.

There ye ſee <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt, but not the beſt of the ſonnes of men, after hee had taken a deepe draught in the cryſtaline cup of worldly proſperities, and given his heart to ſeeke and ſearch out by wiſe-dome all things that are done under heaven, upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them all with this true ſaying;<note n="h" place="margin">Eccles. 1.14.</note>

               <p n="3">III. If ſuch be the condition of Kings, of Princes, of Courtiers, of Stateſmen who have their portion in this life, and ſeeme to be in a ſafe harbour againſt all kindes of ſtormes, and in all weathers; who is able to relate all the troubles which diſquiet the mindes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and ſteepe the few drams of worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which they taſte but ſeldome in their lives, with a quintall of gall? One bewaileth the death of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne: another curſeth the day wherin he was made the father of a man childe: this man complaineth of his wives diſloyaltie: that man conveyeth his wife to the ſepulchre, with ſadneſſe and teares. He who lived in eaſe, is aſhamed to ſee himſelfe ſtript of all that he had; and he who ſpoyled him, is amazed when he is alſo ſpoyled by another ſtronger than himſelfe. One amongſt an hundred, mourneth for the death of his friend, who was to him more faithfull and ſteadable than a brother; but manie fret and are much moved, when they ſee their familiar friends, in whom they truſted, and in whoſe boſome they did lay all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, lift up their heeles againſt them.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, there is no tongue that can fully ex preſſe all the evils that are incident to man in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſtate; neither is there any man, who feeleth not, with paine, the portion of thoſe evils which is ſhared unto him. As they that ſayle in ſhallow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

               <p n="4">IV. But amongſt and above all men, <hi>many are the evils of the righteous man,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid when hee was forced, through feare,<note place="margin">1.

And becauſe this ſaying is confirmed by the experience of all ages, and therefore it may ſeeme very ſtrange, that a righteous man ſhould be ſo ſtorm-beaten with afflictions, he mitigateth the bitterneſſe of this averred ſentence, with the ſweetneſſe of this no leſſe experimented concluſion; <hi>But the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Text taketh you by the hand, and pointeth out to you, <hi>first,</hi> a righteous man, and his manifold afflictions; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> the LORD and his deliveries: whereunto if ye adde a queſtion, which is implyed in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12290:9"/>the firſt part, why the LORD permitteth the righteous man to be ſo roughly uſed; ye ſhal have in theſe parts the matter of ſundry Sermons: the <hi>first,</hi> of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, and of the characters whereby he is known. The <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third,</hi> of the evils wherewith the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is on all ſides thunder-ſtricken. The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fift,</hi> of the cauſes wherefore Almighty GOD, and his loving father, ſuffereth him to be puſhed and toſſed to and fro with ſo manie evils. The reſt ſhall be of the Lords deliverances. Let us then begin at the firſt part; and our beginning and helpe be in the Name of the Lord, who hath made heaven and earth. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. If ye define and deſcribe exactly <hi>the righteous man,</hi> by the rules of the Law, which aſcribeth this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and moſt excellent title to thoſe onely, whoſe perſons are (from the womb) without ſpot, whoſe actions are without ſinne, and in whoſe lives Gods all-ſeeing eyes can perceive no blemiſh; let Papiſts ſay what they will, we will truly ſay with <hi>David</hi> in the Old Teſtament,<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal 14.10.</note>

That man is Satans worke, and the bitter fruit of the rebellion of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> This man is the worke of Gods Spirit, and the ſweet fruit of the obedience of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> That man <hi>is corrupt by deceitfull lusts,</hi> and therefore is ever buſied in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us away from goodneſſe, and entiſing us to evill.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12290:10"/>good. That man is ſtrong and mightie: This man is feeble, and withſtandeth with great difficultie. That man, though very powerfull &amp; hard to be overcome, waxeth old and decayeth from day to day, untill he be altogether deſtroyed: This man increaſeth every day in might and vigour; and like the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, when they were upon their journey, aſcending to appeare before God in Sion, goeth<note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 84.7.</note> 
                  <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> till he come<note n="l" place="margin">Epheſ. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Christ.</hi> So that man is at the laſt ſubdued, overthrowne and killed by this man, as the monſtrous Gyant <hi>Goliah</hi> was by little <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> That man, where he reigneth, bringeth forth for fruit<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 6.21, 22.</note>

               </p>
               <p>From hence it is, that God, when he is to ſpeake and make us know what account he maketh of his ſervants, conſidereth them not according unto thoſe relickes of the old man, whoſe ſtrength is weakened, and whoſe life decayeth and dyeth every day, to call them <hi>Sinners and wicked ones:</hi> but for his<note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note>

But ſuch is the force and glory of juſtice, and of righteouſneſſe, that the wicked, when they know they doe wickedly, cloake their wicked courſes againſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12290:36"/>the righteous man with the glorious title of juſtice. Now whatſoever the perſecuters thinke of their owne proceedings, the righteous man reſteth upon his owne innocencie; knowing that there is not ſo great weight in the deſpightfull girds of venemous tongues, as in the teſtimonie of his owne conſcience: and if hee were admitted to make an Apologie for himſelfe, how eaſie a matter were it unto him to maintaine his owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, and to ſhew the falſhood of all the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby he is made odious; and the manifeſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the moſt part of them?</p>

And why may not he, who is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the gowt in his ioynts, racked with the gravell in his kidneyes, tortured with the ſtone in his bladder; or he who melteth drop after drop by a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing conſumption; he who is made one of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked order by his wife; he whoſe ſonne is made, for his lewd like, the decking of a gallowes, &amp;c. cry out againſt us, A faggot for the Huguenauts, a heape of wood to burne the Parpaillants? as the ancient Idolaters, and forefathers of the new Idolaters of this time, were wont

               <p n="1">1. It is permitted to all others which are arraigned, to ſpeake in their owne defence whatſoever they can or may; or if they cannot ſpeake, to hyre the mercenary tongue of ſome Lawyer, who without any ſuſpicious of crime may anſwer, contradict, ſay whatſoever he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fitteſt for the commendation of the innocencie of his Client, though knowne to be guiltie, and worthy of death: for the Lawes will not ſuffer, that any man ſhould be condemned, not heard, and without a free defence. We are the onely men whoſe mouthes are ſhut, and often gagged, for feare that we ſpeake too cleerely: They will not have us to ſpeake, becauſe they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to condemne us; knowing, that if we ſpeake, our innocencie will ſhine like the beames of the Sunne in a faire ſummer day, and they cannot chuſe but abſolve us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though he who is arraigned, take the crime upon him, he is not, upon his ſimple confeſſion, ſent to the gallowes; but the Iudge knowing that there are many <hi>perire volentes,</hi> who deſire to die, to cleere his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, inquireth diligently of the antecedents, the conſequents, the place, the time, the manner, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and partakers, and all other qualities and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the fact. There is no ſuch inquirie made for or againſt us; wherein wee have offended the high Powers, where and when we pat out the candles, how many Virgins we have defiled, with which of our kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women wee have committed inceſt: wee are called
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:12290:37"/>
                  <hi>Huguenauts,</hi> which to our Iudges, without further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, is a name and proving of all crimes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All other criminalls if they deny, are tortured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they confeſſe: The end of racking is to wring out confeſſion. If it be prevented by confeſſion, it hath no uſe: when it hath extorted confeſſion, it ceaſeth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Tyrants onely, racking is a puniſhment: wee confeſſe freely what we are, we tell our Iudges that we are reformed Chriſtians, or as ye ſpeake here, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi> we ſpeake the truth, and lye not. Our Iudges will not heare what we are: they will have us lye, and to confeſſe what we are not. Therefore they racke us, to make us deny. If other criminals deny, they beleeve them not: if we deny our ſelves to be Proteſtants, if we lye falſly, and ſay we are Rome Catholikes, they be leeve us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is no Iudge unpartiall, which deſireth to abſolve other malefactors; and therefore they are not conſtrained to deny, but racked untill they confeſſe, that they may be condemned: wee onely are forced to deny, that we may be abſolved: when wee ſpeake the truth, and confeſſe what we are, we are put to death: when yeelding to their violence, wee faine, and deny our Religion, not onely they ſuffer us to live, but alſo they reward us for our lying. Art thou and Huguenaut? Yea: Racke him. Art thou an Huguenaut? Alas, no, no. Hangman unbinde him, let him goe; he is an honeſt man, and muſt be recompenced. Whereby it is moſt evident, that wee are cleane of all crimes laide to our charge, except our Iudges will confeſſe, that in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when we deny our Religion, they puniſh not high treaſon, adulteries, inceſts, murther, and a great many more crimes, whereof we are dayly accuſed. If that were iniquitie againſt the common wealth, and the State, they muſt needs grant that wee are guiltie of our Religion onely, or rather of the onely name thereof. For it is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12290:38"/>condemned when it is not knowne; when it is known, it is imbraced: And therefore our Perſecuters will not know it, becauſe they will condemne it; perceiving that all thoſe which have condemned it, when they knew it not, have ceaſed to condemne it, yea profeſſed and protected it, when they knew it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, as a Chirurgion by plaiſters draweth out into the skinne the inward impoſtume which is hid in the fleſh, that by ſuppuration it may be healed: ſo God by temptations bringeth men to the acknowledgement of their hid ſinnes and naturall weakneſſe; that finding how prone they are to evill, and how weake to reſiſt it, they truſt not any more in themſelves, but in God,<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.9.</note>

                  <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poore, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven, and come and follow me;</hi> if he had come by this commandement to the knowledge of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, which lay lurking in his narrow heart: for then he had not gone away ſorrowfull, but had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his hidden corruption, and cryed to the Lord, Helpe my weakneſſe. For that commandement was not a precept requiring <hi>actuall obedience;</hi> but a precept of <hi>Tryall,</hi> to diſcloſe his inſatiate avarice, and make it knowne to himſelfe and others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Arabian incenſe, and moſt excellent ſpices perfume not the air with their ſweet ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, till they be rubbed, brayed, or caſt into the fire: and as the moſt precious jewells have a more ſhining

Gold is gold whereſoever it be, and keepeth its owne beautie and gracefulneſſe: but put it in the Creuſet, caſt it in the fire, and it ſhall caſt a more gliſtering brightneſſe than it did before. The righteous man is Gods gold, and a precious jewell in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: In all ſtates, his innoceny, integritie, meekeneſſe, is knowne to ſome men; but ſpecially his faith is made manifeſt when he is in the fierie furnace of tribulation: then his droſſe and tinne is evaporated, and vaniſheth away like ſmoake; then the goodly metall of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces holds firme: then they give more light, and ſhew more grace, than all the gold of Ophir. As it is written in the eleventh chapter of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> v. 35. That <hi>ſome of them of underſtanding, ſhall fall, to try them, and to purge and make them white, even to the time of the end:</hi> and as it is ſaid in the third chapter of <hi>Malachy,</hi> v. 2, 3.

               <p>Therfore God, to ſhew that his Saints are not ſlaves, or hirelings, ſerving him for the reward, but loving and reſpectuous children, walking before him with an upright heart for conſcience ſake; giveth all that <hi>Iob</hi>

When they ſlept, and he hoped that the night ſhould eaſe his complaint, his adverſary ſcared him with dreames, and terrified him through viſions: yee ſee with what ſleight and might his enemy ſtruggleth with him, how hee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to ſupplant him, to wring out of him ſome uncomely word againſt God.

Alas! ſaith hee, I have done all that I could: I have done nothing of that which I intended, for hee hath not curſed God: for this I plotted all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes againſt him.

The orientall pearles are not ſo faire as his pockes: the ſmelling of roſes is not ſo ſweete as the ſtinke of his breath; his ſores are cleerer and brighter than the beames of the Sun.

His enemies ſealed and guarded the Sepulchre where hee was buried, and ſaid,<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal 3.2.</note>

Thoſe, whoſe habitation before that time was night and day in the Tavernes, departed not from the holy aſſemblies, crying to God for grace, mercie and peace, with faſting and prayers night &amp; day.

                  <hi>the beaſt ſhould make warre againſt them, and overcome them, and kill them.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo written of<note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 7.9, 14.</note> thoſe which ſtood before the throne, that they <hi>came out of great tribulation,</hi> and yet <hi>had palmes in their hands.</hi> They <hi>came out of great tribulation,</hi> they were vanquiſhed: <hi>they had palmes, in their hands,</hi> they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers.

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:12290:92"/>
               <p>How ſhall we reconcile this contrarietie? ye will all grant, that the Generall of an Armie, fighting againſt his enemies, whatſoever dammage and harme hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and procureth unto them, preuaileth not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is overcome of them, if ſtill they keepe faſt that wherefore he fighteth, and which he hoped to pull away from them by violence. So it is with us. The divell, great Generall of the world, ſtirreth up againſt us the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> all the fiends of hell, all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of the earth, not to torment us, to ſpoyle us of our goods, to kill us, for neither is hee covetous of our goods, nor enemy to our perſons, which hee loveth when we are like to himſelfe; but by ſuch racking, ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, killing, to wring out of us a denying of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to ſeparate us from the love of God, and make us to loſe our ſalvation which is in Chriſt. When then we hold faſt the ſhield of faith, wherewith we quench all the fierie darts of the wicked, when we remaine faithfull unto death, when in the midſt of our greateſt anguiſhes, and of moſt exquiſite deaths, we challenge, and defie all our enemies, and cry to them all,<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8.35.</note>

               <p n="12">XII. A few examples will make this truth more cleer.

               <p>The example of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach, and Abednego</hi> is no leſſe wonderfull. The divell put in<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> heart to ſet up, in the plaine of <hi>Dura,</hi> in the Province of Babylon, an image of gold, whoſe height was threeſcore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12290:92"/>cubits, and the breadth thereof ſixe cubits, to call to the dedication of that Idol the Princes, Governours, all the Rulers of the Provinces, to dedicate it with the melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt pleaſant ſound of the Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Pſalterie, Dulcimer. and all kinds of muſick, to command to all peoples, nations, and languages there preſent, to fall downe and worſhip it at what time they ſhould heare the conſort of muſicke; to adde to this command a moſt fearefull threat, that <hi>whoſoever fell not downe and worſhipped, ſhould the ſame houre bee caſt into the midſt of a burning fierie furnace.</hi> For whom was made all this pompe, all this glorious ſhew? for whom did the inſtruments of muſicke ſound ſo ſweetly? for whom did the furnace burne ſo exceedingly? For theſe three onely: for the divell knew that all the reſt of the Kings ſubiects would obey, and worſhip the image. Ye ſee a combate very difficult, ambuſhes moſt dangerous, a gulfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, a bottomleſſe pit, a downe-right pitch on both ſides, pleaſure and feare; the delectable harmonie of all kinds of muſick, to allure the ſimple ones; the frightfull ſight of a burning furnace, to appall and amaze the moſt inflexible and obdurate courages. See the event: there is nothing but obedience amongſt all: All bow, all kneel, all worſhip; three onely ſtand upright, and kneele not. Whereupon they are accuſed by certaine Caldeans. The accuſation is important: <hi>There are,</hi> ſay they, <hi>certaine Iewes,</hi> not thy naturall Subiects, but ſtrangers, and thy ſlaves, <hi>whom thou haſt ſet over the affaires of the Province of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> preferring them to thy naturall Subiects, and the great men of thy countrey, even <hi>Shadrach, Meſchah, and Abednego: theſe men, O King, have not regarded thee.</hi> Theſe baſe and unthankefull fellowes have contemned and deſpiſed thee. What accuſation could bee more cunningly plaited? but as many accuſations, as many praiſes: As many crimes intended, as many commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of godlineſſe: the King frets, chafes, threatneth,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12290:93"/>
                  <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye fall not downe, and worſhip not the image which I have made, ye ſhall be caſt the ſame houre into the midſt of a fierie furnace, and who is that God that ſhall deliver you out of my hands?</hi> As many threats, as many victories: as many beholders, as many witneſſes of their triumphs. They fight alone, they vanquiſh alone, they triumph alone. And that which maketh their combat admirable, and their victorie glorious, after that all have yeelded, all have bowed their knees to the Idol, they ſtand firme, and ſtirre not. They diſpute not with themſelves; Loe, all the honourable, all the wiſe, all the rich men of the Realme, and all the people obey the King, what will men thinke of us, if we alone ſtruggle and be ſtubborne? If we had gone formoſt to honour the Image, we might be called too forward: but if after ſo many thouſands we yeeld to neceſſitie; if wee follow the multitude and the beſt ſort, who can juſtly blame us? Moreover, if wee frame our wills to the Kings will, wee may releeve and further our brethren: whereas our obſtinacy will make their bondage more grievous than it was. Such politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conſiderations come not in their minds, farre leſſe in their mouths: but they anſwer with a more than man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage, <hi>Our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fierie furnace: yea, he is able to deliver us out of thine hand, O King: but if not, be it knowne unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy golden Image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> O faith in God, O love to God, O conſtancy for God!

               <p n="2">II. For even then, God ſpake to many of his Saints, as he did to the Iewes in their tribulation, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to hide themſelves in their cabinets, untill the time of indignation were overpaſt, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord would come certainely, and puniſh all their perſecuters for their iniquity, and namely, the authors of ſuch blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding, and ſo joyne with their overthrow, the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie of his Church. The remnant of the Church hid themſelves, the moment of the Lords wrath paſt, Gods enemies were deſtroyed, the Church was delivered, and ſtill flouriſheth and yeeldeth moſt excellent fruit, to the glory of the Lord our deliverer, and to the eternall ſhame and confuſion of our perſecuters.</p>
               <p>Here is then a new matter to be handled, concerning the manner and the time of the Lords deliveries, which is ſet downe by the Prophet in three ſeverall points: The firſt is a commandement which God giveth to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chamber, and ſhut thy doores about thee.</hi> The ſecond is, how long they muſt lye hid after this manner: not for ever, not for a long time, but <hi>for a little moment, untill the indignation bee overpaſt.</hi> The third is the reaſon why they muſt lurke till then: becauſe then God will bee avenged of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>For behold the Lord commeth out of his place, to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. God ſpeaketh to his people by his Prophet, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12290:99"/>giveth them a moſt excellent counſell, <hi>to enter into their cabinets, and to ſhut their doores about them:</hi> which if ye take litterally, is a counſell <hi>of holy prudence;</hi> if ye take it allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, it is a counſell <hi>of godly patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtian and holy prudence is the rule of the righteous mans actions, teaching him how to carry himſelfe in all occurrences of times, places, and perſons, and how to frame and fit unto them all his actions, privy and publike, domeſticall, civill, and religious. As in time of perſecution, it will teach him neither to be too timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to forſake his vocation, whereunto God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him; nor yet too raſh, and foole-hardy to tempt God, by caſting himſelfe into unneceſſarie dangers, whereof the word of God (which <hi>David</hi> called<note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 119 105.</note> 
                  <hi>a lampe unto his feete, and a light unto his path</hi>) giveth both precepts and examples.</p>
               <p>When we are aſſured, that God calleth us to confeſſe his holy Name, and to glorifie his Majeſtie, eyther by profeſſing openly his word, and preaching of it, or by ſuffering for it; then we muſt not aske, and farre leſſe take counſell, of fleſh and blood, but remember the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,<note n="e" place="margin">Math. 10.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Feare not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather feare him which is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoule and body in hell.</hi> Worldly prudence will ſay: Theſe men to whom God ſendeth thee, are mighty and cruell, and will kill thee; therefore take heed to thy ſelfe, and flye. Sanctified prudence will anſwer; God which hath ſent me, is ſtronger, and therefore will I not flye.<note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>In the LORD put I my truſt: how ſay ye to my ſoule, Flee as a bird to your mountaine?</hi> When God ſent <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint <hi>David,</hi> worldly wiſedome anſwered in him,<note n="g" place="margin">1. Sam. 16.2.</note> 
                  <hi>How can I goe? If</hi> Saul <hi>heare it, he will kill me.</hi> God ſpake unto him againe, and confirmed him: then hee gave place to the commandement, and went.

                  <hi>Ionah</hi> yeeldeth too much to his own diſcourſe, and too little to Gods commandement, when, being ſent to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> hee tooke ſhipping to flee unto Tarſhiſh <hi>from the preſence of the Lord:</hi> which would have beene a foule fault in any private man inſtructed in the wayes of the Lord, how much more was it heinous in a Prophet? for who is ſo negligently and ſlightly imbrued with the knowledge of God, but hee will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to that ſaying of <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 139.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I aſcend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there: If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt parts, even there ſhall thy hand leade me, and thy right hand ſhall hold me: If I ſay, ſurely the darkneſſe ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me: even the night ſhall be light about me: yea, the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth as the day; the darkeneſſe and the light are both alike to thee. Ionah</hi> learned by an experimentall knowledge this to be true, when the ſhip wherein he thought to flee from the preſence of the Lord, was unto him as a paire of ſtockes to hold him faſt.</p>

               <p>When we have ſuch a revelation, or by any other meanes are certified, that God will have us to remaine and confeſſe, then this precept of <hi>Eſaiah,</hi> of hiding our ſelves in our cloſets, is no wayes directed unto us, but rather this of Chriſt,<note n="o" place="margin">Mar. 10.27.</note>

               <p n="8">VIII. It is a naturall thing to all living creatures to provide for their owne ſafetie: Neither hath God, the author of nature, aboliſhed that naturall inſtinct in his Saints, but ſanctified it, directing them by his word and by his Spirit to doe lawfully and holily, that is to ſay, by good meanes and for a good end, that whereunto they are inclined by nature.</p>
               <p>If they did otherwayes, might they not be iuſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of tempting of the Lord their God, of preventing his providence, of ſeeking through vaine-glorie and oſtentation to be Chriſts Martyrs, when he craveth no ſuch dutie at their hands? <hi>Peter</hi> being too bold out of ſeaſon, denyed his Maſter. The reſt of the Diſciples which fled, and kept themſelves quiet, ſhunned that miſchiefe. For God bleſſeth rather a modeſt fleeing, than a preſumptuous abode. When <hi>Peter</hi> ruſht into <hi>Caiphas</hi> Hall, the Spirit of God left him: But when<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh 20.19.</note> he was hid with the reſt in a chamber, the doores being ſhut for feare of the Iewes, Ieſus came to them, and<note n="d" place="margin">Act 2.1.4.</note> the holy Ghoſt deſcended upon them. In <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, there was a kinde of heretiques, called <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellions,</hi> which ran every where ſeeking the martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and the Franciſcane Friers write of <hi>Francis</hi> their Patron, that he went <hi>to Maiorka, Minorka,</hi> and other places occupied by the Maliumetanes, deſirous to be killed for Chriſts ſake: But he returned as he went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of thoſe miſcreants would debaſe themſelves to flay ſuch a calfe. Now what was that deſire, but gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, but raſhneſſe, but preſumption and vaineglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? A wiſe and experimented Pilot will never runne his ſhip upon the ſhelves and rocks: If the ſtorme drive him upon the dangers, then he ſheweth his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and skill: So a modeſt man will not, to ſhew his courage, caſt himſelfe into the fire of affliction, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12290:103"/>draw upon himſelfe unneceſſarie evils: but if he be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, if the glory of God, if the edification of the Church; if the neceſſitie of his calling binde him to ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, then he will ſhew that when he lurked, courage was not wanting to his warineſſe, but his warineſſe ruled his courage, and commanded it to waite vpon the Lord. Hee which ſeeketh enemies wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and raſhly, is a ſeditious and factious fellow: But he which hath enemies, and ſeeketh them not, which is perſecuted without cauſe, or for Gods cauſe; Hee which cannot ſhun them, nor have peace with them, except he forſake his ſtation, denie Chriſt, ſcandalize the Church, and then chuſeth rather an honeſt and glorious death, than a diſhoneſt life, is the truly wiſe and courageous man.

And therefore the ancient Church called ſuch men <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> whereas the perſecutors, and hypocrites, call them <hi>Denyers.</hi> If they were willing to deny, would they flee? would they leave their goods, forſake their friends, hazard their lives to deny?
